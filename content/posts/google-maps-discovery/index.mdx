# Summary
One issue I've had with google maps is it doesn't let you see a table of new places in an area, sorted by opening date.
I quickly made my own by calling the google maps place API and saving the output to a text file, and adding git commits with the date of discovery.
It is not perfect, as many old places simply do not show up on the first search, but its better than complaining about the Google Maps UI.

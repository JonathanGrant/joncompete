# Projects

#### Raycasting C++ Project
I started working on this to learn C++, Linear Algebra, template metaprogramming, and eventually SIMD & CUDA programming.
Currently stage 1 of the project works where I can see an extremely basic scene with one sphere.

# NYC Hikes

## Broadway Hike
My friend and I hiked North to South Manhattan staying entirely on Broadway Ave.
Was interesting to see the streets above 145th, which I've never seen before.

## Great Saunter / Manhattan Perimeter
The Broadway hike was a warmup for this.
My legs still hurt.
The west side especially by Inwood is beautiful!
The east side is mostly under construction or very empty, and so wasn't as enjoyable.

# Engagement

I was so excited that I ran my second half-marathon the next day and got less than two hours!

# New OpenAI Apis
Right before Sam Altman was fired (and then re-hired), OpenAI's Dev Day introduced many great improvements.

1. 120k context for GPT4
2. TTS API (with 10x better pricing than Eleven Labs)
3. DallE3 API

Needless to say, I spent $160 this month on OpenAI APIs (average was $60).

## Podcast updates
<PodcastEmbed podcastId="arxiv-podcast-gpt-computer-science/id1694283581" />
Listen to the new episodes (after Nov 11th).
Notice the better TTS (before I was using Google Translate) and the better content.
The better content is because I can do the whole podcast in one chunk rather than in groups, due to the much larger context size, because the entire paper fits in the context window.

## Paper2Video updates
I gave Paper2Video another try, now with Dalle3 and 120k context, and got some great results.

And these were generated without a paper, only a small text prompt.

# Baking
## ICE Chocolate
I went to a chocolate bonbon class at ICE in NYC. It was really good, we were taught by a michelin star pastry chef.

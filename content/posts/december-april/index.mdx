Oh man... I got lazy and didn't post anything ðŸ˜….

Spent most of december fostering Sienna, a great rescue pup. By now she's been adopted for a long time (not by me) and living her best life.
She took so much time and energy I don't remember doing much else.

The other thing I remember is listening to game theory lectures from 2009, I listened while picking up Sienna's ðŸ’©.

Oh, and I climbed my first (and still only) v6!

This was a fun month!
I went to Ethiopia and Rwanda, and saw lots of animals.

Becca and I did an engagement photoshoot. There's like 300+ amazing photos so I'm limiting myself to just 3 here.

It was also a leap year, so I spent the extra day playing soccer.

Spent this month preparing for asia trip, and had a short trip to Denver.

Important news from here is I motorized my window blinds using $25 tool from AliExpress!
Now I connected to Alexa and can ask "her" to "open/close the curtains", as well as automate them to go down when the sun is strong and up when its gone.

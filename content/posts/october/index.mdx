# Eye surgery
I got SMILE surgery, which is like LASIK but faster recovery. No more glasses!

# Dall-E3 Weatherboy
I updated the <a href="/weatherboy" target="_blank">Weatherboy</a> project to use DallE-3, and its quite good now.

I had to use a hacky API interface which used a web-browser, since this is before the official API came out (11/6).

# Baking
I got really into baking this month. I made mostly high-protein desserts, usually aiming for low carbs and fat.
This ended up with most things tasting pretty dry due to protein powder and lack of oil.
I visited my mom and at the end of the trip (just a few days) we realized we baked 11 things.
